# Adding In New Features - mep76


Planned feature to change: add a view that shows all turtle images and allows
the user to change the image when they click on a turtle. 

### Estimation:
**How Long It'll Take:**  
Personally, I think it'll take 45 minutes to an hour to make these changes
to SLogo. I would think it'd be shorter, but I am going to work on a
front-end feature instead of a back-end feature. This is for three reasons. 
The first is that I remember feeling like the Parser wouldn't actually
need to change if I added new commands. Additionally, I kind of want to
experience trying to make changes to others' code to see if I can figure out
what they did (and also if my teammates had as good of design that I thought).
Finally, we had already implemented the two backend commands so I wanted to 
do the other extension. 

**How Many Files Changes**
Because this is front-end and I worked on back-end, I'm not entirely sure
how many files will need to be changed. However, I anticipate that it will
be no more than two or three files, because it is a relatively small change
that is specific to the front-end.
